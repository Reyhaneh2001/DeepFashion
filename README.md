# ðŸ‘— DeepFashion: Visualizing and Classifying Fashion MNIST with Keras Functional API

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end pipeline for image classification using the **Fashion MNIST** dataset. It includes **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **data preprocessing**, **visualizations**, and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built using the **Keras Functional API**.




## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights  
- **Data preprocessing**: scaling, one-hot encoding, reshaping  
- CNN with **Batch Normalization**, **Dropout**, and **Early Stopping**  
- Built with **Keras Functional API** 
- Model evaluation with **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report**  




## Dataset

- **Fashion MNIST**: A dataset of 70,000 grayscale images (28x28) of 10 fashion categories  
- Comes preloaded with Keras: `tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist`
